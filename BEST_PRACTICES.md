# Shell Implementation Best Practices

## Security & Safety
- [ ] Validate input and sanitize commands
- [ ] Implement proper signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGCHLD)
- [ ] Use `execve()` family functions correctly to prevent injection
- [ ] Handle file descriptors properly to avoid leaks
- [ ] Implement proper process group management
- [ ] Prevent command injection attacks
- [ ] Handle setuid/setgid programs safely

## Performance & Resource Management
- [ ] Use efficient parsing algorithms
- [ ] Implement proper memory management
- [ ] Handle large command outputs gracefully
- [ ] Avoid blocking on I/O operations
- [ ] Implement job control for background processes
- [ ] Optimize for common use cases
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup on exit

## Error Handling
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages
- [ ] Handle edge cases (empty input, invalid commands)
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup on errors
- [ ] Handle system call failures gracefully
- [ ] Return appropriate exit codes
- [ ] Handle out-of-memory conditions

## Architecture
- [ ] Separate lexer, parser, and executor components
- [ ] Use state machines for complex parsing
- [ ] Implement modular built-in command system
- [ ] Design for extensibility
- [ ] Maintain clean separation of concerns
- [ ] Use proper abstraction layers

## Testing
- [ ] Test with edge cases and malformed input
- [ ] Verify POSIX compliance with standard test suites
- [ ] Test signal handling and process management
- [ ] Performance testing with large inputs
- [ ] Unit tests for individual components
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
